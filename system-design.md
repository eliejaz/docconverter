## System deign explanation

1. **API Gateway and Rate Limiting**: 
   - The API Gateway serves as the entry point for all client requests, providing load balancing to distribute traffic across multiple instances of your microservices. 
   - Rate limiting is added to prevent abuse of the API resources.

2. **Kafka for queue management**:
   - It decouples the producers (API Gateway) from the consumers (microservices), allowing for scalable and resilient communication.
   - Topics in Kafka ensure that each type of request is handled appropriately.

3. **Kubernetes Cluster**:
   - Running services within a Kubernetes cluster provides orchestration, ensuring that they are highly available and can scale up or down based on demand.
   - Kubernetes also handles self-healing by restarting failed containers, making the system more resilient.
   - Adding more nodes and preferably in more than one availability zone permits a more reliable solution.

4. **Microservices for Document Conversion**:
   - Having multiple instances of the document conversion service ensures that the system can handle multiple requests concurrently, improving throughput and reducing latency.
   - Each instance can scale independently based on the load, ensuring efficient resource utilization.

5. **In-Memory and Persistent Databases**:
   - Using Redis as an in-memory database provides fast access to frequently used data(caching).
   - PostgreSQL as a persistent database ensures that data is stored reliably and can be retrieved when needed.

6. **Distributed File System**:
   - Storing documents in a distributed file system like Hadoop or S3 ensures that the files are stored reliably and can be accessed globally.

7. **Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana**:
   - Prometheus  allows to monitor the health and performance of the system.
   - Grafana provides a rich visualization of these metrics, enabling to quickly identify and address issues.

8. **Logging Monitoring with Better Stack**:
   - A logging solution like Better Stack ensures that we can track and analyze logs from the services, helping in debugging and monitoring the applicationâ€™s behavior.

## blue-green deployment strategy.

Blue-green deployment strategy involves having two identical production environments (Blue and Green). At any time, one environment (e.g., Blue) is live, serving all production traffic, while the other (Green) is idle. When deploying a new version of the application, the idle environment is updated and tested. Once the new version is validated, traffic is switched to the updated environment, making it live. This can be easily done by switching the live kubernetes cluster network interfact to the green network interface.

## Handling Specific Challenges:

1. **Sudden Spike:**
    - **Auto-Scaling:** Use auto-scaling groups to automatically add more instances of microservices based on CPU/memory utilization or queue length.
    - **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting at the API Gateway to control the flow of incoming requests and prevent overloading the system.

2. **Large Documents that Take a Long Time to Process:**
    - **Chunking:** Break large documents into smaller chunks and process them in parallel. Reassemble the document after processing.
    - **Timeout Management:** Set appropriate timeouts and retries for long-running processes. Use a separate queue for handling large documents to prevent blocking other tasks.

3. **System Failures During Conversion Processes:**
    - **Retry Mechanism:** Implement retry logic in the message queue to automatically reprocess failed tasks.
    - **Dead Letter Queue:** Use a dead letter queue to capture and isolate failed tasks for manual inspection and reprocessing.

### Security Considerations:

1. **Data Encryption:**
    - **In-Transit:** Encrypt data during transmission.
    - **At-Rest:** Encrypt documents and metadata stored in databases and storage services.

2. **Authentication and Authorization:**
    - **Roles and Policies:** Define access control using roles and policies to restrict access to services and data.
    - **OAuth2/OpenID Connect:** Implement robust authentication mechanisms using standards like OAuth2 or JWT.
